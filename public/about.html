<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I love a good story. Who doesn't? Hunt them down in my spare time really.  But I hadn't realized how important a good story was till I was halfway through my life.
  It's profound to know that mine is still being written and now that I'm aware enough to acknowledge this truth, the weight I feel, is sometimes
  difficult to carry and yet I am equally excited that it is my own and I feel awestruck knowing that it was given to me to direct myself through this thing we call Life.</p>

<p>Clearly, I like philosophy like I do a good puzzle. The better the puzzle the better the philosophy. Its all just a code with nuances and details that
  reference eachother in ever the slightest of ways but carry such meaningful differences. It reminds me of the phrase "The Devils in the Details." Funny enough, 
  I have never researched the origin of that phrase and hence, its most exacting point, but using it now seems quite correct though somewhat foreboding.

<p>And so, coding. I have dreams beyond this but with all the research that an unindoctrinated, and uneduacated beginner has, this is where I've decided to start my coding story!</p>
